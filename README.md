## General Information


The use case for the project was that both Experis and Noroff had experienced difficulties in maintaining contact with past candidates, notifying them of social events and gathering data for quality assurance purposes. Our primary task was to create an Alumni Network Portal to facilitate this kind of communication.

In the application itself users can register, log in, browse and post messages in various groups and topics, create new topics and groups, subscribe to existing topics or join groups, comment posts, edit their profile information and send private messages to other users.
